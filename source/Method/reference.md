- ◇ [A Letter to Research Students](http://www.jdl.ac.cn/how_to_research/doc/research_A Letter to Research Students.pdf), by Duane A. Bailey. (pdf)
  ( Research can be made more enjoyable and productive through a little organization. For many computer scientists, research techniques are a product of experience rather than, unfortunately, formal training. Several organizational suggestions are outlined here, most of which are useful to the undergraduate researcher. Items in italics are aimed at graduate students, professional researchers, and faculty. Enjoy!)
- ◇ [Research Primer for Graduate Students](http://www.jdl.ac.cn/how_to_research/doc/Research Primer for Graduate Students.pdf), (pdf)
  ( This short paper is intended to help you approach your research in a systematic manner. It is not intended to be a guide on how to conduct research, though you will likely find useful information and tips (especially on the thesis process).

  (This document presumptuously purports to explain how to do research. The authors give heuristics that may be useful in picking up the specific skills needed for research (reading, writing, programming) and for understanding and enjoying the process itself (methodology, topic and advisor selection, and emotional factors). )

- ◇[ How to Succeed in Graduate School: A Guide for Students and Advisors](http://www.jdl.ac.cn/how_to_research/doc/advicea_1.pdf), by Marie desJardins. (pdf)
  This is the latest version of the paper. The original version of it was called [How to be a Good Graduate Student/Advisor](http://www.jdl.ac.cn/how_to_research/doc/How to be a good graduate student.pdf), by Marie desJardins. (pdf)
  (This paper attempts to raise some issues that are important for graduate students to be successful and to get as much out of the process as possible, and for advisors who wish to help their students be successful. The intent is not to provide prescriptive advice -- No formulas for finishing a thesis or twelve-step programs for becoming a better advisor are given -- but to raise awareness on both sides of the advisor-student relationship as to what the expectations are and should be for this relationship, what a graduate student should expect to accomplish, common problems, and where to go if the advisor is not forthcoming.)
